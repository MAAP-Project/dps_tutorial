# DPS Tutorial
A tutorial on how to use the MAAP to develop an algorithm to be run on the 
Data Processing Service (DPS)

## Motivation
The idea of this repository is to demonstrate the various ways in which an 
algorithm can be integrated in the DPS.

This demo will teach you how to:

- Set up the environment required for algorithm to run within DPS 
- Call a python script within the DPS
- Accept parameters to your script
- Read an input file and manipulate it
- Write an output file for DPS to store it
- Write logs to stdout so that they can be viewed later


## Sample Algorithms
 Please have a look at the [gdal_wrapper](gdal_wrapper%2FREADME.md) example to continue this tutorial.
